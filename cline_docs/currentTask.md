# Current Task

## Objective
- Refactor `OpenCone/Features/ProcessingLog/ProcessingView.swift` to use the MVVM pattern for better separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

## Context
- The original `ProcessingView` directly observed `Logger.shared` and contained filtering logic and state management.
- `ProcessingLogEntry` struct was incorrectly located in `DocumentModel.swift`.

## Changes Implemented
- Created `OpenCone/Features/ProcessingLog/ProcessingViewModel.swift` to manage state and logic.
- Moved `ProcessingLogEntry` struct definition to `OpenCone/Core/ProcessingLogEntry.swift`.
- Removed `ProcessingLogEntry` definition from `OpenCone/Features/Documents/DocumentModel.swift`.
- Refactored `ProcessingView.swift` to use `@StateObject` for `ProcessingViewModel` and bind UI elements to the ViewModel.
- Updated the `#Preview` block in `ProcessingView.swift`.

## Next Steps
- **Resolve Build Errors:** The user needs to investigate the persistent "Cannot find type" and "No such module 'UIKit'" errors within the Xcode environment. This likely involves:
    - Checking if `ProcessingViewModel.swift` and `ProcessingLogEntry.swift` are correctly added to the "OpenCone" target membership.
    - Performing a clean build (Cmd+Shift+K) and potentially deleting derived data in Xcode.
- **Testing:** Once build errors are resolved, test the Processing Log feature thoroughly.
- **Update Other Documentation:** Update `codebaseSummary.md` and `techStack.md` (handled in subsequent steps).
