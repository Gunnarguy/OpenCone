# Current Task

## Objective
- Set the iOS application icon using the provided image.

## Context
- The original `Contents.json` for the `AppIcon.appiconset` was non-standard.
- A new `Contents.json` has been created (`OpenCone/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/Contents.json`) configured for automatic icon generation from a single source file.
- The source image provided by the user (`/Users/gunnarhostetler/Documents/Projects/Brand+Media/Icons/8BF53015-9820-4E72-97DB-7899D2E136E8.png`) has been copied to `OpenCone/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/AppIcon-Source-1024.png`.
- Instructions for the user to complete the process in Xcode have been saved to `cline_docs/userInstructions/assign_app_icon.md`.

## Next Steps
- User needs to follow the instructions in `cline_docs/userInstructions/assign_app_icon.md` to assign the `AppIcon-Source-1024.png` image to the App Icon asset in Xcode.
- User should then build and run the application to verify the new icon is applied correctly.
