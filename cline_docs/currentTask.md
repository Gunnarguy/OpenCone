# Current Task: App Icon Implementation

## Objectives
- Configure proper app icon for iOS App Store submission
- Prevent common rejection reasons related to app icons
- Follow Apple's guidelines for iOS 11+ app icons

## Context
The OpenCone app needs to have properly configured app icons to avoid App Store rejection. This includes having correctly sized icons and proper Info.plist configuration.

## Completed Steps
1. Created properly sized app icons:
   - Added a 1024x1024 master icon image
   - Created variants for light, dark, and tinted appearances
   - Organized them in the asset catalog

2. Fixed Info.plist configuration:
   - Removed manually created Info.plist file to avoid conflicts with auto-generated one
   - Added CFBundleIconName key to project settings for both Debug and Release configurations
   - Ensured the app icon asset name matches the CFBundleIconName value

## Next Steps
This task is complete. The app icon is now properly configured for App Store submission.

For future reference, if you need to update the app icon:
1. Replace the image files in Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/ with new 1024x1024 images
2. Ensure Contents.json correctly references these files
3. The CFBundleIconName is already configured in project settings
